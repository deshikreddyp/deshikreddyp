### Hi there 👋

I work on the formulation and numerical solution of PDE-governed systems, with emphasis on finite element and variational methods.
I have worked on surrogate modeling and PINNs; my current interests focus on scientific machine learning for PDEs, particularly uncertainty propagation, Bayesian inference, and PDE-constrained inverse problems.
